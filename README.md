# FinWallet â€” Financial WebApp

This project is financial data and stadistics application using [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

The website is currently under development and I use to add new features in my free time and just for fun in order to improve my web programming skills. As you can clearly see under the demo site below, there is still so much work to do.

## Demo Site

You can take a look to some of these features here: [FinWallet](https://rawgit.com/ferpsanta/FinWallet/master/app/index.html).

You can also register but register is NonRestFull for the moment, so changes done are not permanent.
